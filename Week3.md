## On digital publishing
  A website as a graduate student may also help with structuring my own thoughts and critically thinking about who my interlocutors are or will be. In addition, having a website as a graduate student offers the opportunity to have a concentrated and aesthetically appeasing display of my research interest and ongoing projects. Also while applying to competitive fellowships or grants the cite could function as a way to further explain my multi-disciplinary research interest and experimental methodology and perhaps make me considerably more appetizing as a potential candidate. Inadvertently, I guess I am saying maintaining a website as a graduate student allows me to personally brand myself whether it is in the academy or expanding in multiple job markets. However, I am curious how my research and others alike that discuss “sensitive” topics such as race, class, gender, “rights to city” and other social issues may be received or perhaps mis-label me. 
	One another note I am interested in having a website because I am curious about aesthetics within the digital/ virtual realm and how they play apart of social and cultural constructions of race, class, and gender. I am curious to know what website interface aesthetics are popular, wha do they say about the person, and how do he aesthetics mediate the messages between the author and their interlocutors. this could very well be a horrible example but ill give it a go anyway. For example, you know how some interior design aesthetics invite some people while push others away signaling “too expensive” or “too cool” or other critiques, I wonder if websites aesthetics can also have a similar effect. My hopes are to design a site that can visualize provocative aesthetics that represent the clashing of social issues within class, race, gender and geography. For me, creating a website would bring about another medium to explore my research interest.
	In regard to my reading experience for weeks 3, the articles were not only a timely but also practical. I appreciated how some of the articles even included a “pros and cons list” as to why academics and graduate students should maintain an online presence.
